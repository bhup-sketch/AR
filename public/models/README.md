## Video Plane Model

You need to add a simple GLB file named `video_plane.glb` in this directory. The model should be:

1. A simple plane geometry (quad) with:
   - Width: 1.6 units (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Height: 0.9 units
   - Default position: centered at origin
   - Default rotation: facing forward (0,0,0)

2. Material properties:
   - Base color: white
   - Metallic: 0
   - Roughness: 1
   - Double-sided: true

You can create this model using:
- Blender
- Three.js editor
- Or download a pre-made one from a 3D model repository

The file should be named `video_plane.glb` and placed in this directory.
